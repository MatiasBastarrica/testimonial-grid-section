## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Box-shadow
- Background-image

### What I learned

During the work for this challenge I got comfortable using properties like grid-column, grid-row and box-shadow. I also began to understand the concept of the fractional unit (fr) a bit more.

### Continued development

I wonder if I could achieve this grid layout widthout the media queries and using auto-fit in combination with minmax instead in order to get a more fluid grid.

### Useful resources

- [px to rem](https://nekocalc.com/es/px-a-rem-conversor) - This helped me convert px to rem. I really liked this online calculator and will use it going forward.
- [Background CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand background images. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
